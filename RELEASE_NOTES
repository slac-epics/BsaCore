    DOCUMENTATION: do *not* regenerate automatically but maintain
    a copy of the PDF in git (see README).

R1.5.0:
    Back to the master branch

    DOCUMENTATION: updated

    FEATURE: Added 'configuration' calls that let the user set thread
    priorities.

    FIX: must verify 'numResults' against 'maxResults' before invoking
    callbacks - it could be that a sink with reduced 'maxResults' was
    connected since the results were acquired
    (and thus numResults > maxResults)

    Minor tweaks to get to build under RTEMS 4.9. Condition variables
    cannot use CLOCK_MONOTONIC but use CLOCK_REALTIME on that system.


R1.4.x:
        Workaround version to solve an extra NaN with the old EVG code
        R1.4.x are in the workaround branch which name "ignore_zero_active_count" 

R1.3.3:
	Added 'checkAlarm' helper routine which mimicks EPICS' behavior.
    Provide square root of sample variance as RMS.
    Set severity/status to invalid if # of averaged values has zero
    count.
