    Minor tweaks to get to build under RTEMS 4.9. Condition variables
    cannot use CLOCK_MONOTONIC but use CLOCK_REALTIME on that system.
R1.3.3:
	Added 'checkAlarm' helper routine which mimicks EPICS' behavior.
    Provide square root of sample variance as RMS.
    Set severity/status to invalid if # of averaged values has zero
    count.
